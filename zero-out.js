// could also make a variable to hold the last few pictures chosen, neither random choice can be either of those ... 
// make variable equal to a couple less than max number of pictures so minimal repeating ...

// showChoices function ... 
// put all the pictures into an array
// randomly select a picture
// randomly select another picture, it can't be the same as the first
// put their pictures on the two big buttons (A and B)
// run showChoices

// Listen to button A, listen to button button
// On click function ...
// highlight the choice for two seconds (maybe play a ding noise)
// record the choice count in the record of that picture
// run showChoices
