What kind of experience are my users going to have ...



I'm using this app to [] so [].

I'm using this app to vent frustration and gain some sense of satisfaction.
	-- find people that are not well liked, give satisfaction of downvoting them into oblivion
I'm using this app to distract myself so I can waste time (bus ride, waiting in traffic jam, pooping, etc).
	-- create some distraction with lights and sounds, some light reading by having bios for each of the people
I'm using this app to promote lesser known evils that deserve to get zero'd out.
	-- some submit mechanism to offer suggestions.
I'd like to filter the options to narrow who I'm booting
